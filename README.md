# WHR-Diabetes-Analysis

## Objectives and Data
This project aimed to assess the correlation of different risk factors for diabetes using statistical models. The dataset used addresses risk factors for diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease in study participants living in two counties in Virginia. These risk factos include cholesterol and glucose levels, systolic and diastolic pressures, as well as demographics such as participant age, height, weight, and hip size. This data was collected from 403 male and female participants from Virginia's Buckingham and Louisa counties. Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) is associated with increase risk of type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. The purpose of this analysis is to investigate the exploratory and predictory correlation between WHR and diabetes in a localised community.

## Procedure
### Correlation Analysis
> - WHR was set independently to WHR > 0.85 (females) and WHR > 0.90 (males) to indicate obesity. Additionally, the scale of the glycosylated hemoglobin variable was limited between 5 and 8 to better indicate the transition from pre-diabetes to diabetes. These variablescan be visualized through scatter plots and examined via linear regression to determine either a positive or negative statistical relationship. Furthermore disparities in health outcomes can be examined based on gender.
